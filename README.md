# Snap-On-Reporter
With the ever increasing size of cities, maintenance and organization have become a serious problem. Most people are distressed with the condition of civic amenities today and the delayed response of civic bodies. For such an issue people would want to file a report or post it on a public forum. To tackle similar problems a citizen can act as a reporter. This is a tool to collect news material through crowd-sourcing.
<p>The tool is an application suite that consists of an android application on one end and a web application for the moderator on the other. The android application uses location intelligence to geo-tag images clicked and provides a gamified environment where the users gain points on the basis of  their report content. For uploading the content the user is only required to enter a text description and landmark of the image with everything else being handled by the application itself. The uploaded images are reviewed by the moderator through the web application and the data pertaining to accepted images gets stored in a different collection. The android application can be used in several cases like showing faulty construction work, dirty streets, requirement for repair of roads, traffic issues, a mishap in a public area or any rare incident, and anything which the citizen feels other people should be aware of or qualifies as news.
